# Testing Plan

## Summary
Testing will be done throughout the implementation of each new compenent. The way this testing will look is that usually I will write out the whole implementation as I think it should look and then run my code to see if it works as intended. In most cases I get some runtime errors or the code does not work as expected so I do some debugging just to an implmentation that will run as expected on the most general of my test cases. Then once that runs as expected I will start testing different edge cases and seeing if they come up with the expected result. If they do, go on to the next edge case, otherwise fix the implementation until it does run as expected, and then move on to another edge case. Once, I can't think of any more edge cases to test, I deem the component completed and commit and push to github.
